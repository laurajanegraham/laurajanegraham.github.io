      <description>Land is a limited resource that must fulfil multiple functions. The big question is, how can we meet growing human demand for resources and ensure human well-being, without impairing biodiversity and ecosystem functions?
Such questions necessitate a landscape ecological approach, on the principle that ecosystem composition, structure and function partially depend on the spatial (and temporal) context of the ecosystem (i.e., its landscape context).
In our research we adopt a landscape ecological approach to study a wide range of ecosystem services.</description>

      <title>Climate change impacts on hummingbirds</title>

      <description>Climate change increasingly influences animal populations in both temperate and tropical ecosystems, yet we know little about how the majority of species will respond to these changes. This lack of knowledge limits our ability to predict species responses and manage them in the face of climate change. We are combining time-series data for hummingbirds with climate and remote sensing data to evaluate what changes have occurred in hummingbird populations. We are investigating variation in hummingbird resources and hummingbird physiological responses to different environmental conditions to start to determine why these changes might have occurred.</description>

      <title>Planning urban landscapes for biodiversity</title>

      <description>Conserving biodiversity in urban areas has important implications for human well-being, species persistence and future conservation efforts. Biodiversity has a positive impact on human well-being both directly, and through the provision of ecosystem services. Protecting urban biodiversity can have benefits for species conservation at broader scales: urban remnant habitat can provide crucial habitat for native species that are under threat from agricultural intensification in the wider countryside. Habitat loss and fragmentation together pose one of the greatest threats to species persistence.</description>
