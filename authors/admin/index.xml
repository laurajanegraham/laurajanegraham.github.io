      <description>I am a computational/spatial ecologist interested in understanding how anthropogenic changes such as climate and land-use change affect global ecosystems, and how this in turn affects human well-being. I am particularly interested in using novel statistical methods and heterogeneous sources of data to answer applied and theoretical questions. I was previously a mathematician and database developer, and apply skills learned there to answer ecological questions. My PhD research focussed on applying metapopulation models to urban planning problems; particularly in the context of the ecological impact assessment.</description>
