We calculated apparent survival rates of birds in the Ecuadorian tropical Andes using a moderately long‐term (11 yr) capture–recapture dataset from three habitats that varied in how much they had been modified by human activities (native forest, introduced forest, and shrubs). We fit mark–recapture models for 28 species with habitat as a covariable. For all species, recapture rates between sampling sessions were low and varied from 0.04 for Rainbow Starfrontlets (*Coeligena iris*) to 0.41 for Stripe‐headed Brushfinches (*Arremon assimilis*) when averaged across all occupied habitats. Annual survival rates varied from 0.07 for Black‐crested Warblers (*Margarornis squamiger*) to 0.75 for Violet‐throated Metaltails (*Metallura baroni*). We found no significant differences in survival rates either among habitats or species grouped by habitat specialization. Because we found similar survival rates in native forest and human‐modified habitats, our results support those of recent studies concerning the potential value of secondary habitats for the conservation of some species of birds in the tropics. However, our conclusions are tempered by the uncertainty around the estimates of survival rates. Despite the relatively long‐term nature of our study, obtaining survival estimates for bird species in this region was challenging, and either more years of study or modification of field protocols may be needed to obtain more precise survival estimates.","tags":[],"title":"Survival estimates of bird species across altered habitats in the tropical Andes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura J.

A key aim of ecology is to understand the drivers of ecological patterns, so that we can accurately predict the effects of global environmental change. However, in many cases, predictors are measured at a finer resolution than the ecological response. We therefore require data aggregation methods that avoid loss of information on fine‐grain heterogeneity.\r\n\r\n2. We present a data aggregation method that, unlike current approaches, reduces the loss of information on fine‐grain spatial structure in environmental heterogeneity for use with coarse‐grain ecological datasets. Our method contains three steps: (a) define analysis scales (predictor grain, response grain, scale‐of‐effect); (b) use a moving window to calculate a measure of variability in environment (predictor grain) at the process‐relevant scale (scale‐of‐effect); and (c) aggregate the moving window calculations to the coarsest resolution (response grain). We show the theoretical basis for our method using simulated landscapes and the practical utility with a case study. Our method is available as the grainchanger r package.\r\n\r\n3. The simulations show that information about spatial structure is captured that would have been lost using a direct aggregation approach, and that our method is particularly useful in landscapes with spatial autocorrelation in the environmental predictor variable (e.g. fragmented landscapes) and when the scale‐of‐effect is small relative to the response grain. We use our data aggregation method to find the appropriate scale‐of‐effect of land cover diversity on Eurasian jay Garrulus glandarius abundance in the UK. We then model the interactive effect of land cover heterogeneity and temperature on G. glandarius abundance. Our method enables us quantify this interaction despite the different scales at which these factors influence G. glandarius abundance.\r\n\r\n4. Our data aggregation method allows us to integrate variables that act at varying scales into one model with limited loss of information, which has wide applicability for spatial analyses beyond the specific ecological context considered here. Key ecological applications include being able to estimate the interactive effect of drivers that vary at different scales (such as climate and land cover), and to systematically examine the scale dependence of the effects of environmental heterogeneity in combination with the effects of climate change on biodiversity.","tags":[],"title":"Incorporating fine‐scale environmental heterogeneity into broad‐extent models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca Spake","Chloe Bellamy","Laura J.

Spatial models of variation in the isotopic composition of structural nutrients across habitats (isoscapes) offer information on physical, biogeochemical and anthropogenic processes occurring across space, and provide a tool for retrospective assignment of animals or animal products to their foraging area or geographic origin. The isotopic differences among reference samples used to construct isoscapes may vary spatially and according to non‐spatial terms (e.g. sampling date, or among individual or species effects). Partitioning variance between spatially dependent and spatially independent terms is a critical but overlooked aspect of isoscape creation with important consequences for the design of studies collecting reference data for isoscape creation and the accuracy and precision of isoscape models. \r\n\r\n2. We introduce the use of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to construct isoscape models. Integrated nested Laplace approximation provides a computationally efficient framework to construct spatial models of isotopic variability explicitly addressing additional variation introduced by including multiple reference species (or other recognized sources of variance). \r\n\r\n3. We present carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isoscape models extending over c. 1 million km2 of the UK shelf seas. Models were built using seven different species of jellyfish as spatial reference data and a suite of environmental correlates. Compared to alternative isoscape prediction methods, INLA‐spatial isotope models show high spatial precision and reduced variance. We briefly discuss the likely biogeochemical explanations for the observed spatial isotope distributions. We show for the first time that sulphur isotopes display systematic spatial variation across open marine shelf seas and may therefore be a useful additional tool for marine spatial ecology. \r\n\r\n4. The INLA technique provides a promising tool for generating isoscape models and associated uncertainty surfaces where reference data are accompanied by multiple, quantifiable sources of uncertainty.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial models of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur stable isotope distributions (isoscapes) across a shelf sea: An INLA approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536447600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536447600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://laurajanegraham.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Having seen a few nice looking websites which use the Hugo academic theme, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d have a go at revamping my website.

I just thought I\u0026rsquo;d point out some resources that I found useful.\nI mainly worked from Alistair Bailey\u0026rsquo;s really detailed guide to building a website using blogdown in R.

A further major criticism of current ecological impact assessments is that they tend to be qualitative. Here we develop methods that apply the Incidence Function Model (IFM) in real urban planning contexts, by generating repeatable and comparable quantitative measures of ecological impacts. To demonstrate the methods for a case study (Nottingham, UK), we estimated landscape-scale measures of species' persistence that indicate metapopulation viability. We based these on Nottingham's landscape when urban developments were recently proposed, then adjust the land cover to include the proposed developments, and also for two projected landscapes where 10% and 20% of the original natural or semi-natural land cover is lost. We find that the IFM shows promise as a tool for quantitative landscape-scale ecological impact assessment, depending on the size of the impact. We detected minimal differences in the species' viability measures between the original and post-development landscapes. This suggests that for small (around 2%) cumulative losses of natural/semi-natural space, current site-based approaches are sufficient. However, when the cumulative effect of continued development was modelled by increasing the losses of natural/semi-natural land cover to 10-20% of existing cover, the impact on many of the species studied was more substantial. This indicates that a landscape-scale approach is necessary for larger, prolonged and cumulative habitat losses.","tags":[],"title":"The incidence function model as a tool for landscape-scale ecological impact assessments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura J.

It is important for future monitoring and conservation that we understand where these novel and disappearing assemblages occur and how they differ among dimensions (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) of diversity. Here we investigate the geographical and environmental patterns of novel and disappearing assemblages; whether these patterns hold across dimensions of diversity; and how these assemblages are characterized in trait space. We used ensemble species distribution modelling to estimate the distributions of 151 hummingbird species into the projected climate for 2070. Using standard beta diversity measures, we identified novel and disappearing taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional assemblages. We found that novel and disappearing hummingbird assemblages are likely under climate change, particularly in extreme environments and with novel assemblages replacing disappearing assemblages. Although the patterns of novel and disappearing assemblages were similar among dimensions of diversity, we found that there were fewest novel and disappearing functional assemblages. The future assemblages were characterized by an increase in functional space, which is counter to typical predictions of trait homogenization under climate change. Novel and disappearing assemblages are likely to pose management challenges for future conservation. Here we present an approach to identify such assemblages. By considering the geographic and environmental context of novel and disappearing assemblages for different dimensions of diversity, we can start to identify the mechanisms behind these patterns.","tags":[],"title":"Future geographic patterns of novel and disappearing assemblages across three dimensions of diversity: A case study with Ecuadorian hummingbirds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura J.

It is therefore essential that we develop methods to investigate critical habitat loss thresholds and least detrimental landscape configurations. We develop a framework to assess how the pattern of habitat loss impacts the ecological and social characteristics of a landscape and how this varies depending on the species and criteria by which it is judged. We use a scenario-based approach to test six propositions in which habitat is lost preferentially based on patch characteristics. We use eight bird and two amphibian species as indicator species. To compare scenarios, we present a method combining the output from a metapopulation model with measures of social impacts of land-cover change in a multiple criteria decision analysis. We also determine whether a habitat loss threshold exists, below which small loss of habitat can lead to large loss of species’ occupancy. We found that, of the scenarios presented, preferentially losing common habitats and smaller patches was least detrimental for both ecological and social factors. Threshold effects were found for all but the generalist bird species. We have outlined a workflow which allows for transparent, repeatable comparison between landscapes. This workflow can be used to compare urban landscape plans, or to develop general understanding of the impacts of different forms of habitat loss. Reassuringly, the recommendations based on the scenarios presented are in keeping with received conservation wisdom: to prioritise larger and/or rarer patches.","tags":[],"title":"Metapopulation modelling of long-term urban habitat-loss scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

The presence of nature in cities is, however, important for human well-being and understanding of our environment, and it provides key habitats and connectivity for species’ populations at broader scales (Dearborn and Kark 2010). Thus far, urbanisation has been described as a ‘massive unplanned experiment’ (Niemelä 2011); if cities are to be sustainable they need to be planned at a landscape scale rather than be allowed to develop in an uncoordinated fashion (Wu 2009; Wu 2014).

A key benefit of the IFM is low data requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data; however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems. First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species–area relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions. To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and to target areas for further species recording.","tags":[],"title":"Using citizen science data for conservation planning: Methods for quality control and downscaling for use in stochastic patch occupancy modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Climate change increasingly influences animal populations in both temperate and tropical ecosystems, yet we know little about how the majority of species will respond to these changes.

Habitat loss and fragmentation together pose one of the greatest threats to species persistence.
